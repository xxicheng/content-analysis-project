# Online news coverage of inequality

# Goals: 

This is a course project for SOCI 40133 Computational Content Analysis. The goal is to analyze online English news coverage of inequality. We employed computational methods including the LDA topic modeling, word embeddings, and word and phrase frequency analysis to all news containing "inequality" in the News on the Web (NOW) corpus to see if the coverage given to income inequality from 2010 to 2019 reflects the empirical rise in inequality during the same period. We are also interested in how online media frames income inequality, like the causes and solutions. 

# Methods: 

LDA topic modeling: to see if the online news coverage trend given to income inequality from 2010 to 2019
    
Word embeddings: to describe the general world view of the online news by checking the closeness among the words. After that, I will build several dimensions and project the news onto these dimensions to see if there's any systematic difference (or similarity) in terms of the causes and solutions.

Word and phrase frequency analysis:
